# SolvableTreePlus1
 
This repository contains the code used for the paper 'Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions'.

# Contents
- `src/` source code used in the notebooks
- `CF_OTOC.ipynb` calculates light cone correlation functions and OTOCs for generic tree unitaries and maximum velocity tree unitaries
- `CliffordEE.ipynb` uses Clifford simulations to confirm the analytical formula for entanglement entropy growth
- `GenerateTreeUnitarity.ipynb` provides an algorithm to generate ensembles of gates satisfying the tree-unitarity constraints
- `TreeStructure.ipynb` provides functions useful for working with circuits on trees, including finding the relevant colourings and grouping nodes according to the action of unitaries
